|New Concepts/Techniques/Tools Used|Comment|
|:-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|CSS Clamp Function: ```clamp(min-value,preferred-value,max-value)| used to create a dynamically sized element, while being fixed within bounds|
|Custom Properties|Used to create typescaled font values. |
|Typescale Ratio| Mathematical formulas applied to a base font size to create well proportioned text sizes to be used, used with custom properties and the root pseudoclass to easily access these values when styling elements.|
|Layout First Approach Improvements| 1.Use grid-template-areas and grid-areas to help keep track of the main components, and their sub-assemblies. 2. In order of html structure go component by component building the entire structure. 3. Style the grids after their structure has been created seperately.This prevents mistakes and errors as sometimes it may be difficult to tell if a style choice changed how the page looks, or the grid was defined incorrectly leading to a loss of time and progress.
|minmax() function with percentages| using percentages instead of pixels or fractional units to describe dynamically spaced grid columns|
|grid-template-areas| using grid template areas to layout structure of grid contents by aligning the text accordingly.|
